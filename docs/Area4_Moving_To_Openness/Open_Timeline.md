# US Federal Agencies Timeline to Open Science
The White House rang in the new year by declaring 2023 a _[Year of Open Science](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/)_, featuring actions across the U.S. government to advance open research while accelerating discovery and innovation, promoting public trust, and driving more equitable outcomes. The announcement comes on the heels of the August 2022 Memorandum on _[Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf)_ issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). This guidance marks a major advance in delivering equitable access to America’s research, while enabling all communities to take part in the process and products of discovery.

The policy builds on a foundation of progress and collaboration across federal agencies, as they have worked to further the goals of open science, catalyzed by an OSTP Memorandum issued exactly ten years ago, on February 22, 2013, on _[Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf)_. This ten-year anniversary provided federal agencies with an opportunity to reflect on the great strides they have made as they for the decade ahead – one that will deliver equitable access to discovery and usher new possibilities across the research enterprise.

Below is a living timeline detailing some of the major actions federal agencies have taken since 2013 on their journey towards open science and research.

## 2013 
### 2013 OSTP Memorandum - Public Access Guidance
The [Increasing Access to the Results of Federally Funded Scientific Research](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/ostp_public_access_memo_2013.pdf) policy memorandum (colloquially referred to as the Holdren Memo) directed US Federal agencies with research and development expenditures above $100 million to develop public access plans (see below) to support increased public access to the results of this research. Dr. John Holdren responded directly to a *We The People* petition about the memo when it was released, and that can be read [here](https://petitions.obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/response/increasing-public-access-results-scientific-research/). A White House summary from 2016 about the ongoing impact of the memo can be found [here](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2016/02/22/increasing-access-results-federally-funded-science).

### NSF Promotes Research Infrastructures
NSF continued to fortify research infrastructures that support data sharing within multiple disciplines. Many individual NSF awards advanced data sharing networks and infrastructures in 2022. Major initiatives included:  
* The [Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable Open Science Research Coordination Networks](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22553/nsf22553.htm) or “FAIROS RCN” program, which supports a cohort of 10 three-year, multi-institutional projects to start in 2023, and committed over $12.5 million to open science from all of NSF's seven directorates. 
* The [Research Data Ecosystem](https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/announcements/020422.jsp) data platform to secure and share data at the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research in Ann Arbor. This $38 million investment for transformative and interconnected social and behavioral sciences research is part of NSF's ongoing investment in mid-scale research infrastructure. 

## 2023
### The Year of Open Science
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) [launches 2023 as a Year of Open Science to advance national open science policies across the federal government in 2023](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/). The Year of Open Science features actions across the federal government throughout 2023 to advance national open science policy, provide access to the results of the nation’s taxpayer-supported research, accelerate discovery and innovation, promote public trust, and drive more equitable outcomes. The key initiatives include a unified federal definition of open science: "The principle and practice of making research products and processes available to all, while respecting diverse cultures, maintaining security and privacy, and fostering collaborations, reproducibility, and equity."

### NSF Advances Equity in Open Science
To advance equitable open science and promote public access to that science and to the development of open science networks and cyberinfrastructure, NSF will leverage powerful agency efforts and programs in its [broadening participation portfolio](https://www.nsf.gov/od/broadeningparticipation/bp_portfolio_dynamic.jsp), especially those through the [Growing Research Access for Nationally Transformative Equity and Diversity](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/broadening-participation/granted) program.  Known as GRANTED, this new initiative addresses systemic barriers within the nation's research enterprise by improving research support and service capacity at emerging, developing and underserved research institutions. Public access promotion also complements other NSF efforts, including: 
* The [Minority Serving-Cyberinfrastructure Consortium](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2234326&HistoricalAwards=false) or “MS-CC.” 
* [Build and Broaden: Enhancing Social, Behavioral and Economc Science Research and Capacity at Minority-Serving Institutions](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/build-broaden-enhancing-social-behavioral-economic) or “B2.” 
* New and ongoing award solicitations, such as [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems-pose) and [Campus Cyberinfrastructure](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/campus-cyberinfrastructure-cc), that foreground open science practices.
